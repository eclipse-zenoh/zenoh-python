# Eclipse Zenoh

The Eclipse Zenoh: Zero Overhead Pub/sub, Store/Query and Compute.

Zenoh (pronounce _/zeno/_) unifies data in motion, data at rest and computations. It carefully blends traditional pub/sub with geo-distributed storages, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

Check the website [zenoh.io](http://zenoh.io) and the [roadmap](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap) for more detailed information.

-------------------------------
# Python API

This repository provides a Python binding based on the main [Zenoh implementation written in Rust](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh).

-------------------------------
## How to install it

The Eclipse zenoh-python library is available on [Pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/eclipse-zenoh/).
Install the latest available version using `pip`:
```
pip install eclipse-zenoh
```

To install the latest nightly build of the development version do:
```
pip install eclipse-zenoh-nightly
```

:warning:WARNING:warning: zenoh-python is developped in Rust.
On Pypi.org we provide binary wheels for the most common platforms (Linux x86_64, i686, ARMs, MacOS universal2 and Windows amd64). But also a source distribution package for other platforms.
However, for `pip` to be able to build this source distribution, there are some prerequisites:
 - `pip` version 19.3.1 minimum (for full support of PEP 517).
   (if necessary upgrade it with command: `'sudo pip install --upgrade pip'` )
 - Have a Rust toolchain installed (instructions at https://rustup.rs/)

### Supported Python versions and platforms

zenoh-python has been tested with Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10.

It relies on the [zenoh](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh/tree/master/zenoh) Rust API which require the full `std` library. See the list Rust supported platforms here: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/rustc/platform-support.html .


-------------------------------
## How to build it

> :warning: **WARNING** :warning: : Zenoh and its ecosystem are under active development. When you build from git, make sure you also build from git any other Zenoh repository you plan to use (e.g. binding, plugin, backend, etc.). It may happen that some changes in git are not compatible with the most recent packaged Zenoh release (e.g. deb, docker, pip). We put particular effort in mantaining compatibility between the various git repositories in the Zenoh project. 

Requirements:
 * Python >= 3.7
 * pip >= 19.3.1
 * (Optional) A Python virtual environment (for instance [virtualenv](https://docs.python.org/3.10/tutorial/venv.html) or [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html))
 * [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html). If you already have the Rust toolchain installed, make sure it is up-to-date with:

   ```bash
   $ rustup update
   ```

Steps:
 * Install developments requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

 * Ensure your system can find the building tool `maturin` (installed by previous step).
   For example, it is placed at _$HOME/.local/bin/maturin_ by default on Ubuntu 20.04.
    ```bash
    export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
    ```

 * Build and install zenoh-python:
   * With a virtual environment active:
    ```bash
    maturin develop --release
    ```
   * Without one:
    ```bash
    maturin build --release
    pip install ./target/wheels/<there should only be one .whl file here>
    ```

## Running the Examples

The simplest way to run some of the example is to get a Docker image of the **zenoh** network router (see https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh#how-to-test-it) and then to run the examples on your machine.

Then, run the zenoh-python examples following the instructions in [examples/README.md](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/zenoh-python/tree/master/examples#readme)
