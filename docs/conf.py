# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# You can specify multiple suffix as a list of string:

# The master toctree document.

# The language for content autogenerated by Sphinx. Refer to documentation
# for a list of supported languages.

# This is also used if you do content translation via gettext catalogs.
# Usually you set "language" from the command line for these cases.

# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# a list of builtin themes.
