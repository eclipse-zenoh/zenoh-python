Zenoh API Reference
*******************


`Zenoh <https://zenoh.io>`_ /zeno/ is a stack that unifies data in motion, data at
rest and computations. It elegantly blends traditional pub/sub with geo distributed
storage, queries and computations, while retaining a level of time and space efficiency
that is well beyond any of the mainstream stacks.

The Zenoh protocol allows nodes to form a graph with an arbitrary topology, such as a mesh, 
a star, or a clique. The zenoh routers keeps the network connected and routes the messages
between the nodes.
