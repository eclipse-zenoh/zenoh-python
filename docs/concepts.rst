Components and Concepts
=======================

Session and Config
------------------

Zenoh supports two paradigms of communication: publish/subscribe and query/reply. The entities
that perform communication (for example, publishers, subscribers, queriers, and queryables) are
declared through a :class:`zenoh.Session`. A session is created by the :func:`zenoh.open` function,
which takes a :class:`zenoh.Config` as an argument.

Publish/Subscribe
-----------------

Data is published via a :class:`zenoh.Publisher`, which is declared using
:meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_publisher`. The publisher exposes two primary operations:
:meth:`zenoh.Publisher.put` and :meth:`zenoh.Publisher.delete`. Publishing can also be performed
directly from the session via :meth:`zenoh.Session.put` and :meth:`zenoh.Session.delete`.

Published data is received as :class:`zenoh.Sample` instances by a :class:`zenoh.Subscriber`,
which is declared using :meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_subscriber`.

Publishing can express two different semantics:

- producing a sequence of values
- updating a single value associated with a key expression

In the second case, it is necessary to indicate that a key is no longer associated
with any value; the :meth:`zenoh.Publisher.delete` operation is used for this.

On the receiving side, the subscriber distinguishes between
:attr:`zenoh.SampleKind.PUT` and :attr:`zenoh.SampleKind.DELETE` using the
:attr:`zenoh.Sample.kind` field in the :class:`zenoh.Sample` structure.

The delete operation allows a subscriber to work with a :class:`zenoh.Queryable`
that caches the values associated with key expressions.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

**Declaring a publisher and publishing data**

.. code-block:: python

    publisher = session.declare_publisher("key/expression")
    publisher.put("value")

**Declaring a subscriber and receiving data**

.. code-block:: python

    subscriber = session.declare_subscriber("key/expression")
    for sample in subscriber:
        print(f">> Received {sample.payload.to_string()}")

**Using session methods directly**

.. code-block:: python

    # Direct put operation
    session.put("key/expression", "value")
    
    # Direct delete operation  
    session.delete("key/expression")

Query/Reply
-----------

In the query/reply paradigm, data is made available by a :class:`zenoh.Queryable` and
requested by a :class:`zenoh.Querier` or directly via :meth:`zenoh.Session.get`.

A :class:`zenoh.Queryable` is declared using :meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_queryable` and
serves :class:`zenoh.Query` requests. The :class:`zenoh.Query` provides
:meth:`zenoh.Query.reply` to send a data sample with :attr:`zenoh.SampleKind.PUT`, and
:meth:`zenoh.Query.reply_del` to send a reply with :attr:`zenoh.SampleKind.DELETE`.
See the Publish/Subscribe section for more details on the difference between the
two sample kinds. Use :meth:`zenoh.Query.reply_err` to send a reply containing
error information.

Data is requested from queryables via :meth:`zenoh.Session.get` or via a
:class:`zenoh.Querier` object. Each request returns zero or more
:class:`zenoh.Reply` structures â€” one per queryable that matches the request.
Each reply contains either a :class:`zenoh.Sample` or a :class:`zenoh.ReplyError`.

Query Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The query/reply API allows specifying additional parameters for the request. These
parameters are passed to the get operation using the :class:`zenoh.Selector`
syntax. The selector string has a syntax similar to a URL: it is a key expression
followed by a question mark and a list of parameters in the format "name=value",
separated by ``;``. For example: ``key/expression?param1=value1;param2=value2``.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

**Declaring a queryable**

.. code-block:: python

    # Queryable that replies with temperature data for a given day
    queryable = session.declare_queryable("room/temperature/history")
    for query in queryable:
        if "day" in query.selector.parameters:
            day = query.selector.parameters["day"]
            if day in temperature_data:
                query.reply("room/temperature/history", temperature_data[day])
            else:
                query.reply_del("no data for this day")
        else:
            query.reply_err("missing day parameter")

**Requesting data using Session.get**

.. code-block:: python

    # Request temperature for a specific day
    replies = session.get("room/temperature/history?day=2023-03-15")
    for reply in replies:
        if reply.ok:
            print(f">> Temperature is {reply.ok.payload.to_string()}")
        else:
            print(f">> Error: {reply.err.payload.to_string()}")

**Using a Querier**

.. code-block:: python

    # Declare a querier for multiple queries
    querier = session.declare_querier("room/temperature/history")
    
    # Send a query with parameters
    replies = querier.get(parameters="?day=2023-03-15")
    for reply in replies:
        if reply.ok:
            print(f">> Temperature is {reply.ok.payload.to_string()}")
        else:
            print(f">> Error: {reply.err.payload.to_string()}") 

Key Expressions
---------------

`Key expressions <https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/blob/main/rfcs/ALL/Key%20Expressions.md>`_ are Zenoh's address space.

In Zenoh, data is associated with keys in the form of a slash-separated path, e.g., ``robot/sensor/temp``. The
requesting side uses key expressions to address the data of interest. Key expressions can contain
wildcards:

- ``*`` matches any chunk (a chunk is a sequence of characters between ``/`` separators)
- ``**`` matches any number of chunks (including zero chunks)

For example:
- ``robot/sensor/*`` matches ``robot/sensor/temp``, ``robot/sensor/humidity``, etc.
- ``robot/**`` matches ``robot/sensor/temp``, ``robot/actuator/motor``, ``robot/status``, etc.

The :class:`zenoh.KeyExpr` class provides validation and operations on key
expressions. Key expressions can be created using the constructor, which
validates the syntax of the provided string:

.. code-block:: python

    from zenoh import KeyExpr
    
    # Create a key expression with validation
    sensor_ke = KeyExpr("robot/sensor")
    
    # Join with another segment
    temp_ke = sensor_ke.join("temp")
    
    # Create a wildcard expression
    all_sensors = sensor_ke.join("**")

Key expressions support operations such as intersection and inclusion (see
:meth:`zenoh.KeyExpr.intersects` and :meth:`zenoh.KeyExpr.includes`), which
help determine how different expressions relate to each other.

Key expressions can also be declared with the session to optimize routing and
network usage:

.. code-block:: python

    # Declare a key expression for optimized routing
    declared_ke = session.declare_keyexpr("robot/sensor/temperature")
    
    # Use the declared key expression
    publisher = session.declare_publisher(declared_ke)

Data representation
-------------------

Data is received as :class:`zenoh.Sample` objects, which contain the payload and
associated metadata.
The raw byte payload object is :class:`zenoh.ZBytes`. Serialization and
deserialization of basic types and structures is provided in the :mod:`zenoh.ext`
module via :func:`zenoh.ext.z_serialize` and :func:`zenoh.ext.z_deserialize`.

Scouting
--------

Scouting is the process of discovering Zenoh nodes on the network. The scouting
process depends on the transport layer and the Zenoh configuration. Note that
it is not necessary to explicitly discover other nodes to publish, subscribe, or
query data.
See more details at `scouting documentation <https://zenoh.io/docs/getting-started/deployment/#scouting>`_.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    scout = zenoh.scout(what="peer|router")
    threading.Timer(1.0, lambda: scout.stop()).start()
    for hello in scout:
        print(hello)

Liveliness
----------

Zenoh supports liveliness monitoring to notify when a specified resource appears
or disappears on the network.

Sometimes it is necessary to know whether a Zenoh node is available. While this
can be approximated by declaring special publishers and queryables, there is a
dedicated liveliness API for this use case.

The :meth:`zenoh.Session.liveliness` API allows a node to declare a
:class:`zenoh.LivelinessToken` using :meth:`zenoh.Liveliness.declare_token`,
associated with a key expression. Other nodes can query this key expression via
:meth:`zenoh.Liveliness.get` or subscribe using
:meth:`zenoh.Liveliness.declare_subscriber` to be notified when the token
appears or disappears. The ``history`` parameter of
:meth:`zenoh.Liveliness.declare_subscriber` allows immediate receipt of tokens
that are already present on the network.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Declare a liveliness token

.. code-block:: python

    token = session.liveliness.declare_token("node/A")

Get currently present liveliness tokens

.. code-block:: python

        replies = session.liveliness().get("node/A", timeout=5)
        for reply in replies:
            if reply.ok:
                print(f"Alive token ('{reply.ok.key_expr}')")
            else:
                print(f"Received (ERROR: '{reply.err.payload.to_string()}')")


Check if a liveliness token is present and subscribe to changes

.. code-block:: python

    with session.liveliness().declare_subscriber("node/A", history=True) as sub:
        for sample in sub:
            if sample.kind == zenoh.SampleKind.PUT:
                print(f"Alive token ('{sample.key_expr}')")
            elif sample.kind == zenoh.SampleKind.DELETE:
                print(f"Dropped token ('{sample.key_expr}')")


Matching
--------

The matching API lets the active side of communication (publisher or querier)
learn whether there are interested parties on the other side (subscriber or
queryable). This information can save bandwidth and CPU resources.

Declare a :class:`zenoh.MatchingListener` via
:meth:`zenoh.Publisher.declare_matching_listener` or
:meth:`zenoh.Querier.declare_matching_listener`.

The matching listener behaves like a subscriber, but instead of producing data
samples it yields :class:`zenoh.MatchingStatus` instances whenever the matching
status changes â€” for example, when the first matching subscriber or queryable
appears or when the last one disappears.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

**Declare a matching listener for a publisher**

.. code-block:: python

    publisher = session.declare_publisher("key/expression")
    listener = publisher.declare_matching_listener()
    for status in listener:
        if status.matching:
            print(">> Publisher has at least one matching subscriber")
        else:
            print(">> Publisher has no matching subscribers")

**Declare a matching listener for a querier**

.. code-block:: python

    querier = session.declare_querier("service/endpoint")
    listener = querier.declare_matching_listener()
    for status in listener:
        if status.matching:
            print(">> Querier has at least one matching queryable")
        else:
            print(">> Querier has no matching queryables")

Channels and callbacks
----------------------

There are two ways to receive sequential data from Zenoh primitives (for
example, a series of :class:`zenoh.Sample` objects from a
:class:`zenoh.Subscriber` or :class:`zenoh.Reply` objects from a
:class:`zenoh.Query`): by channel or by callback.

This behavior is controlled by the ``handler`` parameter of the declare
methods (for example, :meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_subscriber` and
:meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_querier`). The parameter can be either a callable
(a function or a method) or a channel type (blocking
:class:`zenoh.FifoChannel` or non-blocking :class:`zenoh.RingChannel`). By
default, the ``handler`` parameter is set to :class:`zenoh.FifoChannel`.

When constructed with a channel, the returned object is iterable and can be
used in a ``for`` loop to receive data sequentially. It also provides explicit
methods such as :meth:`zenoh.Subscriber.recv` to wait for data and
:meth:`zenoh.Subscriber.try_recv` to attempt a non-blocking receive. The
subscriber (or queryable) is stopped when the object goes out of scope or when
:meth:`zenoh.Subscriber.undeclare` is called.

When constructed with a callback, the returned object is not iterable. The
callable is invoked for each received :class:`zenoh.Sample` or
:class:`zenoh.Reply`. With a callback the object is started in "background"
mode, which means the subscriber or queryable remains active even if the
returned object goes out of scope. This allows declaring a subscriber or
queryable without managing the returned object's lifetime.
