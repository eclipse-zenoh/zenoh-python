    """Provides access to received Zenoh data.

    `Handler` instances are returned by Zenoh operations that receive data asynchronously.
    Each instance provides methods to access the received data items of type ``_T``.

    `Handler` serves as a common interface for different channel implementations:
    :class:`DefaultHandler`, :class:`FifoChannel`, and :class:`RingChannel`.
    Regardless of which channel type is used, `Handler` provides the same methods
    for data access.

    `Handler` instances are returned by several Zenoh operations:

    - :meth:`zenoh.Session.get` returns `Handler[Reply]` for accessing query replies
    - :meth:`zenoh.Querier.get` returns `Handler[Reply]` for accessing querier replies
    - :meth:`zenoh.Session.declare_subscriber` returns `Subscriber[Handler[Sample]]`
      for accessing received samples

    `Handler` provides both blocking and non-blocking methods to receive data,
    as well as iteration support. The underlying implementation determines the
    specific behavior (FIFO blocking, ring buffer dropping, etc.).

    `DefaultHandler` serves as an opaque wrapper around :class:`FifoChannel` with default
    settings. When no channel or callback is specified for subscribers or queries,
    Zenoh automatically uses this handler.

    This type provides API stability by allowing the underlying default handler
    implementation to change without breaking existing code. Currently, it wraps
    a FIFO queue implementation.

    items will block until space becomes available.

    Note: A slow consumer can block the underlying Zenoh thread if it doesn't
    empty the FifoChannel fast enough. For applications where dropping old
    samples is preferable to blocking, consider using :class:`RingChannel`
    instead.

    `RingChannel` implements FIFO semantics with a dropping strategy when full.
    When the channel reaches its capacity, the oldest elements are dropped to
    make room for newer ones, ensuring that only the most recent data is kept.

    This makes `RingChannel` ideal for applications that need to maintain a
    sliding window of recent data without blocking the producer.

    For applications where data loss is unacceptable and blocking is preferable
    to dropping old samples, consider using :class:`FifoChannel` instead.

class Callback(Generic[_T]):
    """A callback handler that invokes a user-defined function for each received item.

    The `Callback` class provides a way to handle asynchronous data reception by
    calling a user-provided callback function for each item received. It can also
    optionally call a drop function when the associated Zenoh primitive
    (:class:`zenoh.Subscriber`, :class:`zenoh.Querier`, etc.) is undeclared.

    When a `Callback` handler is used, the associated Zenoh primitive runs in
    background mode, meaning the callback continues to execute even if the object
    goes out of scope. For more information about channels and callbacks, see
    :ref:`channels-and-callbacks`.

            A callable that will be invoked for each received item.

            primitive is undeclared and the callback handler is being cleaned up.

        indirect:
            Controls the threading behavior of callback execution. If `True`
            (default), the callback is executed in a separate Python thread,
            allowing for long-running callbacks without blocking Zenoh's internal
            processing. If `False`, the callback is executed directly in the same
            thread that receives the data, which is more efficient but requires
            callbacks to complete quickly to avoid blocking.
