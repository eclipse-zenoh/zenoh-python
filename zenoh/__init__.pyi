       This parameter is not set automatically because :class:`Queryable` itself may serve

class Selector:
    """A selector is the combination of a :class:`KeyExpr`, which defines the set of keys that are relevant to an operation, and a set of :class:`Parameters` with a few intended uses.

    **Creating a Selector**

    A :class:`Selector` can be created from a key expression and optional parameters:

    .. code-block:: python

        selector = zenoh.Selector("key/expression", parameters)

    Or from a complete selector string:

    .. code-block:: python

        selector = zenoh.Selector("key/expression?param1=value1;param2=value2")

    If first parameter is already a complete selector string, the `parameters` should be omitted.

    A selector is the combination of a :class:`KeyExpr`, which defines the set of keys that are relevant to an operation, and a set of :class:`Parameters` with a few intended uses:

    - specifying arguments to a :class:`Queryable`, allowing the passing of Remote Procedure Call parameters
    - filtering by value
    - filtering by metadata, such as the timestamp of a value
    - specifying arguments to zenoh when using the `REST API <https://zenoh.io/docs/apis/rest/>`_

    When in string form, selectors look a lot like a URI, with similar semantics:

    - the ``key_expr`` before the first ``?`` must be a valid key expression.
    - the ``parameters`` after the first ``?`` should be encoded like the query section of a URL:

      - parameters are separated by ``;``
      - the parameter name and value are separated by the first ``=``
      - in the absence of ``=``, the parameter value is considered to be the empty string
      - both name and value should use percent-encoding (URL-encoding) to escape characters
      - defining a value for the same parameter name twice is considered undefined behavior, with the encouraged behaviour being to reject operations when a duplicate parameter is detected

    Zenoh intends to standardize the usage of a set of parameter names. To avoid conflicting with RPC parameters, the Zenoh team has settled on reserving the set of parameter names that start with non-alphanumeric characters.

    :class:`Queryable` implementers are encouraged to prefer these standardized parameter names when implementing their associated features, and to prefix their own parameter names to avoid having conflicting parameter names with other queryables.

    Here are the currently standardized parameters for Zenoh (check the
    `specification page <https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/tree/main/rfcs/ALL/Selectors>`_,
    for the exhaustive list):

    - ``[unstable]`` ``_time``: used to express interest in only values dated within a certain time range, values for this parameter must be readable by the Zenoh Time DSL for the value to be considered valid.
    - ``[unstable]`` ``_anyke``: used in queries to express interest in replies coming from any key expression. By default, only replies whose key expression match query's key expression are accepted. ``_anyke`` disables the query-reply key expression matching check.

`scout` spawns a task that periodically sends scout messages and waits for :class:`zenoh.Hello` replies.
The scouting process can be stopped by calling :meth:`zenoh.Scout.stop` on the returned :class:`zenoh.Scout` object,
or by letting the :class:`zenoh.Scout` object go out of scope (dropping it).

Args:
    handler: Optional handler for processing received :class:`zenoh.Hello` messages.
    what: Optional :class:`zenoh.WhatAmIMatcher` or string specifying which node types to scout for
    (e.g., "peer|router"). If None, scouts for all node types.
    config: Optional :class:`zenoh.Config` for the scouting session.
